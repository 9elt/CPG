# cpg
#### Consistent Password Generator.

> this project is under development, and hasn't been reviewed by a cryptographer [other limitations](#limitations)

A CLI that consistently generates passwords given the same input.

## concept

**cpg** is not a password manager, but can be used
as an **additional security layer** on top of it.

The actual password used to sign up, and sign in, to services
**will not be stored anywhere** as it will be generated every time instead.

```
 input    >       salt    =>    password
   ^                ^              ^
   |                |              |
 store it        genrated      use it to 
 online or       and stored    sign up and sign in
 remember it     locally       to services
```

## installation

```
cargo install cpg
```

see: 
[**installing binaries with cargo install**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-04-installing-binaries.html), [**install rust and cargo**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

## basic usage

`-p` list of passwords to salt

`-s` path to the salt to use *(default ~/.conifg/cpg/secret.salt)*

> this is an example, you should use stronger inputs

```
$ cpg -p mybirthday iloveyou "mickey mouse"

mybirthday => 0#B[?7WZbufDrh#z{nJXPD8G6pP]BGQk
iloveyou => g3s5PKVbm1NK8UZFlyjxgsA%g5urG05#
mickey mouse => 1,it6rT^%=#geUO853q|â‚¬%B#@T4B"fjy
```

### limitations

* no salt encryption method yet.

* inputs are not removed from `.bash_history` .
